### Image Viewer with Comments Bar

For all the images in a folder, this script adds a comment bar and comment underneath the image by extracting the "comment" section from the image's metadata.

#### Usage

Ensure the python environment has ```PIL```, ```textwrap``` and ```glob``` installed. Then run: ```python imageViewer.py```

Feel free to change the ```path``` variable provided in the beginning of the file to a different location.

After each image is displayed, press ```n``` for the next image, ```b``` for (back) previous image, ```q``` to quit.
